# Matrix calculator

This Python library is a basic matrix calculator, made for personal use and my practice. With this library, you can easily perform many basic calculations.

There is an `exemples.ipynb` file in the repository which shows how each function works.

Available methods:
- is_square(A)
- is_identity(A)
- transpose(A)
- addition(A, B)
- substraction(A, B)
- multiplication(A, B)
- drop(A, col, row)
- det(A)
- cofactor(A, col, row)
- trace(A)
- cofactor_matrix(A)
- adjugate_matrix(A)
- inverse_matrix(A)
